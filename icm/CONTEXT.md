# CONTEXT.md - VoiceMaster ICM Router

## Task Routing

| If task involves... | Go to stage |
| --- | --- |
| discovery, Understand the task, inspect the project, research, and identify constraints. | `stages/01-discovery/` |
| plan, Turn discovery into a focused implementation and verification plan. | `stages/02-plan/` |
| implement, Make scoped edits while following project rules. | `stages/03-implement/` |
| verify, Run builds, tests, lint, audits, screenshots, or manual checks. | `stages/04-verify/` |
| handoff, Summarize outcomes, update durable logs, and prepare commit or PR notes. | `stages/05-handoff/` |

## How to Start Any Task

1. Read this router.
2. Select the single best stage for the current task.
3. Open that stage's `CONTEXT.md`.
4. Load only the files named in the stage Inputs table.
5. Execute the process and write durable artifacts to `output/` when useful.
